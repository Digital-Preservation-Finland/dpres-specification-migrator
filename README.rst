Specification Migration Tools
==================

This tool is intended to be used for migrating an OAIS Information Package
METS document according to the specifications of the Finnish National Digital
Preservation Services. The tool contains code for modifying and updating
the information package METS document to a newer version of the national
specifications. The tool also support creating Dissemination Information
Packages (DIP) by modifying the METS document's RECORDSTATUS attribute and
producing a DIP METS according to the national specifications.


Installation
------------

Installation and usage require Python 2.7.
The software is tested with Python 2.7 with Centos 7.x / RHEL 7.x releases.

For running in a tested and isolated environment, get python-virtuelenv
software::

    pip install virtualenv

Run the following to activate the virtual environment::

    virtualenv .venv
    source ./.venv/bin/activate

Install the required software with the command::

    pip install -r requirements_github.txt


Scripts
-------

transform_mets
    for modifying the METS document by removing unsupported metadata,
    updating the metadata to a newer version of the specifications and 
    optionally changing the RECORDSTATUS of the document.

The script can take the following options:

    `--output_filename`: specify the name of the created METS document
    `--to_version`: specify the version of the specifications to migrate to
    `--contractid`: the value of the contract ID (mandatory when migrating to
    version 1.7.0 of the specifications)
    `--record_status`: set the RECORDSTATUS of the document, the value
    'dissemination' will create a DIP document
    `--objid`: specify the OBJID when migrating to a DIP document
    `--workspace`: the workspace directory


Usage
-----

The script produces a mets.xml file in the parametrized folder 'workspace'
(unless the '--output_filename' argument is used to specify the name of the
file).

To migrate a METS document located in the tests/data/mets folder to a newer
version of the finnish national specifications use the script as follows::

    python dissemination/scripts/transform_mets.py tests/data/mets/mets_1_4.xml
    --workspace ./workspace --contractid <contract id>

The script will update the METS document so that it conforms to the version
1.7.0 of the specifications of the Finnsih National Digital Preservation
Services. The updated file is written into the workspace directory.
The 'contractid' argument is mandatory when migrating to version '1.7.0'.

Optionally the version of the specifications to migrate the METS document to,
can be specified by using the '--to_version' argument::

    python dissemination/scripts/transform_mets.py tests/data/mets/mets_1_4.xml
    --to_version 1.Â´6 --workspace ./workspace

The argument '--to_version' accepts values from a predifined list only. Please
note that it is not possible to convert a document to an older version of the
specifications than the document's version itself.

To transform the METS into a DIP METS use the '--record_status' argument::

    python dissemination/scripts/transform_mets.py tests/data/mets/mets_1_4.xml
    --record_status dissemination --workspace ./workspace --contractid
    <contract ID> --objid <OBJID>

This will create a DIP METS document from the input file as well as migrating
it to a newer version if possible.

When creating a DIP METS it is possible to specify the METS OBJID with the
'--objid' argument. Note that this argument is ignored when only migrating the
METS to a newer version without creating a DIP document.
